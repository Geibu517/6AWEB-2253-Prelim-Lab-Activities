      <p class="profile-text">
        As an aspiring web development student in my third year, I am focused on strengthening my skills to
        become a professional full-stack developer. I enjoy creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces
        while also exploring backend logic that brings applications to life. My goal is to continuously improve by
        improving user engagement by up to 75% through innovative design and optimized code. I am currently
        building real projects, experimenting with modern tools, and learning industry best practices. I’m motivated
        to contribute to meaningful digital solutions and eventually work in a role where I can grow while helping create impactful web experiences.
